# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
The MVP for my project is to create an app will generate Dungeons & Dragons characters for users. When I was in high school I bought a program that was able to generate characters. I cannot convey the amount of happiness that brought my friends and I, let alone the time saved. However, not long after they brought out a new ruleset (3.5) that made my program obsolete. Keep in mind, this was 2003 and updating software over the internet wasn't really a big thing back then. So, some stuff worked and some stuff didn't, but I eventually bought a Mac and the program was incompatible.

Flash forward to today and I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons with a new group of friends. There are three character creators that I know of and they all generate basic characters quite efficiently. So why bother? Well, my friends live across the nation: Florida, Maryland, New York and of course, Missouri. We can't just get together and play. Not only that, these existing character creators don't have the capacity for custom content, which is really the soul of Dungeons & Dragons. It's a game that's played on paper, the adventure is all in your mind. So I want to take it a step further and have a character creator that can create persistent, custom characters that can actually play campaigns with one another over the internet.
### Features
- User signup: Users will be able to create accounts, login and have an account page.
- User-generated content: users will be able to create custom races and (hopefully) classes.
- Persistence: Characters will be stored in a database, able to be recalled and updated.
- Ways to share content: Ways to share your custom content.
- Character life cycles: Ways to create and level a character from level 1 to level 20, not just spit out a static list of data.
- Support for character racial and class abilities: I don't just want to create something that will show me a list of abilities like every other character creator. I want abilities that can be used.
- Fun: I want a game that gives a more accurate depiction of playing Dungeons & Dragons. Did your character fail horribly or achieve greatly? Have the Gods (your friend) decided to smite you for eating the last Cheeto? That needs to be in there (eventually).
### Technologies
- Java
- Intellij
- MySQL
- MAMP
- Hibernate
- Thymeleaf
- HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Crud Repositories (A lot of them. We're talking tables on tables on tables)
### What I'll Have to Learn
Most of what I want to accomplish I don't yet know. I did not choose this application because it would be easy, I chose it because I knew it would be very hard. Not only will I have to learn Dungeons & Dragons intimately, but I've already had to make tough decisions on what is an unreasonable liberty to grant to users. I am also using more up-to-date versions of many of the programs we've used in class so many of the methods we learned from class are obsolete. I am constantly having to learn new methods and statements to create functions and features similar to what we did in class.

I also have to become quite skilled with object-oriented programming. Each ability, action and trait will have to be its own object. It also has to be persistent and linked to a character. That character, being controlled by a user, within a campaign will need to be able to do things that are unique to them. They'll also need to be able to interact with other characters and monsters.
### Project Tracker
I've been working on this project for over a month so far, so much of what I've done so far won't be included on the board, but I've started a Trello board for my application.
